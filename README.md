# simplicity

I know. I have a todo list app on my github. So does everyone. But this is different I promise!

For years I used to use an app called Nozbe. It was great, I loved it. But the company that made it slowly started pivoting away to a new app they build aimed more at enterprise users. They slowly started deprecating Nozbe, and I realised I needed to find a new app.

Over the years I'd basically figured out loads of workaround to get Nozbe to work how I wanted. I tried to see if there was an app that could natively do all these things, but I had no luck. Anything that had the features I wanted was either ugly as shit, or IOS only. 

So here we are, I wrote my own.
